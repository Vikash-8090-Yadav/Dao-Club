## üí°Introduction

IC CLUB stands as a pioneering platform, revolutionizing the landscape of investment management. At its core, IC CLUB is designed to empower users by providing a decentralized, agile, and bureaucracy-free environment for managing investment clubs. The platform leverages innovative technologies to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency in investment processes.

One of the standout features of IC CLUB is its commitment to decentralization. Through the use of blockchain technology, the platform ensures that investment club data is transparent, secure, and immutable. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for intermediaries, putting control directly into the hands of the users.'
 
## üí°Our Vision
At IC CLUB, we envision a future where investment management is seamlessly woven into the fabric of decentralization, empowerment, and innovation. Our vision is to transform the traditional landscape of investment clubs by pioneering a platform that empowers individuals, nurtures financial autonomy, and redefines the norms of transparency and security.

In this future, IC CLUB stands as a beacon of decentralization, embracing the power of blockchain technology to forge a new era in investment management. We see a world where users have direct control over their financial endeavors, free from the constraints of bureaucracy and intermediaries. The platform is designed to be agile, responsive, and tailored to the needs of those who seek a more transparent, secure, and efficient investment experience.

# Proof of critical usage of Filecoin Virtual Machine:

Implementing a comprehensive on-chain governance system allows DataDAO members to create and vote on proposals, covering aspects such as member management, dataset storage and distribution, and token distribution. This ensures a democratic and transparent decision-making process within the DAO.

## Economic Model for Dataset Value Generation:

We've designed a dynamic economic model that enables DataDAO members to generate value from the datasets they manage. This includes mechanisms for monetizing datasets and ensuring fair token distribution among contributors.


## Filecoin Storage Deal Aggregator:

Our project utilizes the Filecoin network for decentralized and secure storage of datasets. We integrate the Lighthouse aggregator/SDK to facilitate seamless storage deals, providing DataDAO members with efficient tools to manage their datasets.

## Proof of Data Storage Inclusion (PoDSI):

We incorporate methodologies for receiving, recording, and verifying storage deal inclusion proofs (PoDSI). This cryptographic proof ensures the integrity and authenticity of stored datasets, adding trust and reliability to the entire system.

## Job Registration for Dataset Health:

DataDAO members can register Replication as a Service (RaaS) jobs with Lighthouse to guarantee the health of their datasets. This includes functionalities for replications, renewals, and repairs, ensuring the longevity and availability of stored data.

## Incentivizing Filecoin Storage Providers:
The FVM is instrumental in cryptographically proving the value and utility of datasets stored by the DataDAO. This proof is crucial for objectively expressing and transacting the value of data within markets. By leveraging the FVM, our project creates a secure and verifiable environment that incentivizes Filecoin Storage Providers to actively participate in storing and serving datasets.

# What it does

## Create Data Dao Investment Clubs

- Users can easily create investment clubs by providing a club name.
- The club becomes associated with the account of the user who creates it (owner).

## Create and Vote on Proposals

- Members who contribute funds to the club pool can create proposals.
- Proposals include a description, amount (not exceeding the pool amount), and recipient for potential investments.
- All members can approve or reject proposals with one vote per member on each proposal.

## Execute and Close proposal

- Proposal owners, with greater approval than rejection, can execute proposals.
- Can't execute in voting periods which last for 5 min after creation. 
- This action transfers the proposal amount to the specified recipient.
- Owners can also close proposals for various reasons, such as cancellation or to avoid sending funds.

## üîçThe problem it solves

In the face of systemic challenges within the traditional private investment fund market, IC CLUB emerges as a transformative solution, addressing the longstanding barriers that have hindered the participation of aspiring investors in funding initiatives for innovative projects, including startups.

<br>

## üí• Challenges we ran into

**MOTOKO:**
- Building scalable smart contracts is a challenging task that requires hard work and dedication. Despite the difficulties, I was able to make it happen. Our main challenge was to make the contract dynamic and responsive to all users. For instance, if a user adds a course, it should only be visible on their dashboard, not to everyone who logs in to the DApp.
