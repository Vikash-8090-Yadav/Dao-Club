# Data Dao Club

Dao Club allows you to manage investment clubs, and to spread access to participate in investment funds to anyone, decentralized, agile, and without bureaucracy.Implementing a comprehensive on-chain governance system allows DataDAO members to create and vote on proposals, covering aspects such as member management, dataset storage and distribution, and token distribution. This ensures a democratic and transparent decision-making process within the DAO.

## üí°Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized finance, Dao Club emerges as a groundbreaking platform, offering a seamless solution for managing investment clubs and democratizing access to investment funds. This innovative platform is designed to be decentralized, agile, and free from bureaucratic hurdles, providing users with unparalleled flexibility in their investment strategies.

DataDAO members can create and vote on proposals, covering aspects such as member management, dataset storage and distribution, and token distribution. This ensures a democratic and transparent decision-making process within the DAO.
One of the standout features of DAO CLUB is its commitment to decentralization. Through the use of blockchain technology, the platform ensures that investment club data is transparent, secure, and immutable. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for intermediaries, putting control directly into the hands of the users.'

# Proof of critical usage of Filecoin Virtual Machine:

Implementing a comprehensive on-chain governance system allows DataDAO members to create and vote on proposals, covering aspects such as member management, dataset storage and distribution, and token distribution. This ensures a democratic and transparent decision-making process within the DAO.

## Economic Model for Dataset Value Generation:

We've designed a dynamic economic model that enables DataDAO members to generate value from the datasets they manage. This includes mechanisms for monetizing datasets and ensuring fair token distribution among contributors.


## Filecoin Storage Deal Aggregator:

Our project utilizes the Filecoin network for decentralized and secure storage of datasets. We integrate the Lighthouse aggregator/SDK to facilitate seamless storage deals, providing DataDAO members with efficient tools to manage their datasets.

## Proof of Data Storage Inclusion (PoDSI):

We incorporate methodologies for receiving, recording, and verifying storage deal inclusion proofs (PoDSI). This cryptographic proof ensures the integrity and authenticity of stored datasets, adding trust and reliability to the entire system.

## Job Registration for Dataset Health:

DataDAO members can register Replication as a Service (RaaS) jobs with Lighthouse to guarantee the health of their datasets. This includes functionalities for replications, renewals, and repairs, ensuring the longevity and availability of stored data.

## Incentivizing Filecoin Storage Providers:
The FVM is instrumental in cryptographically proving the value and utility of datasets stored by the DataDAO. This proof is crucial for objectively expressing and transacting the value of data within markets. By leveraging the FVM, our project creates a secure and verifiable environment that incentivizes Filecoin Storage Providers to actively participate in storing and serving datasets.

# What it does

## Create Data Dao Investment Clubs

- Users can easily create investment clubs by providing a club name.
- The club becomes associated with the account of the user who creates it (owner).

## Join or Leave and Contribute to the Club 
- Data Dao Members can contribute to the common fund (pool) by depositing ICP coins.
- Contributions can be utilized in proposals.

## Create and Vote on Proposals

- Members who contribute funds to the club pool can create proposals.
- Proposals include a description, amount (not exceeding the pool amount), and recipient for potential investments.
- All members can approve or reject proposals with one vote per member on each proposal.

## Execute and Close proposal

- Proposal owners, with greater approval than rejection, can execute proposals.
- Can't execute in voting periods which last for 5 min after creation. 
- This action transfers the proposal amount to the specified recipient.
- Owners can also close proposals for various reasons, such as cancellation or to avoid sending funds.

## üîçThe problem it solves

#### Unleashing the Potential of DataDAOs on Filecoin with FVM Integration

With the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) now live on the Filecoin mainnet, a new era of programmability around storage has emerged, offering direct access to the dataset state on the Filecoin network. This smart contract layer presents a unique opportunity to catalyze the development of DataDAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations for Data) on FVM, unlocking the potential to curate, preserve, monetize, and promote a myriad of valuable datasets to generate substantial value for stakeholders.

<br>

## üí• Challenges we ran into

**LightHouse:**
-I am new to LightHouse and understanding RAAS, and PODSI is quite interesting and  difficult too. This led to several issues/errors which were solved with the help of amazing community support of Filecoin and Lighthouse
- Gets lots of  errors in Storage provider incentives, Deal status, storage  this time the issue is with my local internet   took me 4 hours to understand this.

  **FVM**
  - Understanding the  DATA DAO is not as easy as the short name is,  I Faced an issue  in deploying the address, and integrating hardhat with FVM but again due to the amazing community I solved the issue
  - If I log in with the  very new transaction wallet with no previous history then am get one gas error which is coming due to the new  account and it's again solved by the community as I have to create the ACTOR first by doing any  transaction.
