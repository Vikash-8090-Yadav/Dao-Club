## Deal and storage status

## üîçThe problem it solves

In the face of systemic challenges within the traditional private investment fund market, IC CLUB emerges as a transformative solution, addressing the longstanding barriers that have hindered the participation of aspiring investors in funding initiatives for innovative projects, including startups.

<br>

## üí• Challenges we ran into

**MOTOKO:**
- Building scalable smart contracts is a challenging task that requires hard work and dedication. Despite the difficulties, I was able to make it happen. Our main challenge was to make the contract dynamic and responsive to all users. For instance, if a user adds a course, it should only be visible on their dashboard, not to everyone who logs in to the DApp.
